# Tic-Tac-Toe-Web-Game
To build a Tic-Tac-Toe web game, you need to implement the game logic using JavaScript along with HTML and CSS for the UI. Start by creating a 3x3 grid using HTML <div> elements styled with CSS to look like a board. Each cell should be clickable, and JavaScript should handle player moves by tracking the game state in an array. Use event listeners to detect clicks and update the grid with "X" or "O" alternately. Implement logic to check for a win condition by evaluating rows, columns, and diagonals after each move. If a player gets three marks in a row, display a winning message. Also, handle a draw scenario when all cells are filled without a winner. Include a reset button to restart the game. Optionally, you can enhance the game by adding AI for single-player mode using the Minimax algorithm, animations for better user experience, and score tracking for multiple rounds.
